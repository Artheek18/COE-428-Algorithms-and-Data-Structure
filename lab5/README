***ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS***
 Question 1:
     Which hash table collision resolution method did you use
     (eg. chaining or open addressing)? Explain your choice
     briefly (less than 25 words).
 YOUR ANSWER:
 Chaining was used since elements can be added freely while the table doesn't fill up.
 
 
 
 Question 2:
       Which hash function (division or multiplication) did you use?
       How did you convert a string into a number?
 YOUR ANSWER:
  Division by moding the sum of the tags using the HASH_table.
  Convert the string into number by taking Ascii equivalent of each character. 
 
 
 
 Question 3:
       Another legal XML tag not used in this lab is the
       stand-alone tag.  This kind of tag
       combines both a start-tag and end-tag in one.
       It is identified with a '/' (slash) preceding the
       final >.  (For example, the <foo/>
       is a stand-alone tag that is self balancing.
       
       Describe briefly how
       you would modify Part 3 to allow this kind of tag.
