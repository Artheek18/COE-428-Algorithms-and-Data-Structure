For this lab, i wasnt able to figure out how to make the delete. I test my code for the lab and for the change command you have to type the command without space(e.g type c0A instead of c 0 A). All I was able to understand from this lab was how to utilise 
pointers. In my opinion, a linked list, preferably a circular linked list 
would have been more effective than using just pointers since the state machines 
work as a circular linked list.
